The Project is generated using below technologies 

FrontEnd: ReactJS 
BackEnd: Spring Boot

In fronend folder I have stored reactjs which is frontend.

and In backend folder there is backend part which is spring boot project.

Just import the backend project in sts(ide) and run as spring boot app and import front end project in visual studio code or any ide and start it using npm start.

Note: Change databse properties in application.properties file in spring boot project.
